# VR-Interview
The VR Interview Simulator leverages cutting-edge technologies to create an immersive and AI-driven job interview training platform. Built using Unity/Unreal Engine for VR development, AI-driven Natural Language Processing (NLP) for dynamic questioning, and speech recognition for real-time feedback, this system provides an interactive and adaptive learning experience for users.

The VR environment is designed using 3D modeling and real-time rendering, creating a realistic virtual office space where users can engage in AI-generated interview sessions. The interviewer, powered by machine learning models such as GPT-based dialogue systems, dynamically adapts to the user's responses, ensuring a non-repetitive and personalized experience. Additionally, the system integrates speech-to-text APIs (Google Speech-to-Text, OpenAI Whisper) to evaluate fluency, response relevance, and confidence levels.

To enhance user assessment, the platform incorporates computer vision and eye-tracking (using VR headset sensors or external cameras) to monitor user engagement and provide behavioral analytics. The system also includes sentiment analysis and tone detection to assess confidence levels. A feedback module powered by data visualization techniques offers insights into strengths, weaknesses, and areas of improvement, ensuring that candidates can refine their skills efficiently.

By combining Virtual Reality, AI, and behavioral analytics, this project aims to revolutionize interview preparation, providing a data-driven, interactive, and scalable solution for job seekers.
